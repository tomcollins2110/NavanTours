    <li>The American Revolution began in 1775 as a colonial revolt 
        against British rule. The thirteen American colonies declared their 
        independence in 1776, and the war continued until 1783, when Great Britain 
        recognized the independence of the United States. The American Revolution had 
        a profound impact on world history, as it inspired other revolutions and movements 
        for independence throughout the world.</li>

        The Renaissance was a cultural and intellectual movement that began in Italy in the 
        14th century and spread throughout Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. It marked 
        a period of renewed interest in classical learning and culture, and a revival of the 
        arts and sciences. The Renaissance had a significant impact on European history, as 
        it laid the foundation for the modern era and influenced the development of literature, 
        art, music, philosophy, and science.</li>
